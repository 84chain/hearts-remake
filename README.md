# hearts-remake
because we fucked up the first one

this is a version of hearts that differs from traditional hearts rules

you can find the traditional rules here: https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/hearts/

in this version, you need not break hearts, and you may play a heart or the queen of spades in the first round

you always pass cards - left, right, then across

Points:
- 2, 3, 4 of hearts are worth 0 points
- 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 of hearts are worth 10 points
- J of hearts is 20 points
- Q of hearts is 30 points
- K of hearts is 40 points
- A of hearts is 50 points
- Q of spades is 100 points
- J of diamonds is -100 points
- 10 of clubs doubles your points, if you have *no other point cards* in your hand (this includes the 2, 3, 4 of hearts), it is -50 points.

shooting the moon requires 2, 3, 4 of hearts, but not Q of spades

shooting the moon turns all positive point values negative (full hearts shoot: -200 points, hearts + Q: -300 points, hearts + J: -300 points, all point cards: -800 points)

Known bugs:
- counting points after shooting the moon is bugged
